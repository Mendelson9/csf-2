Reflection:

Wednesday Nov 8 2013
Scanned over assignment and code 
Attempted problem 1 for about 2 hours until I fell asleep
2 1/2 hours

Thursday Nov 9 2013
Tried to implement what I had learned in lab, was unsuccessful
(Note: sorry for leaving lab early we were under the impression it was still 
going to end an hour early, and we had to get to work)
Returned to the readings in case there was something there,
there was probably something there and I did not find it.
This probably took the better part of 3 hours.
I kept trying until about 9PM, so thats probably another hour and a half.
2.5 + 4.5 = 7 hours

Friday Nov 10 2013
Tried for about another hour or so,
Gave up. 

In total: ~8.5 hours
